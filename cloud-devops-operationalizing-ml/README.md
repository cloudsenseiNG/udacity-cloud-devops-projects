## Project Overview

The project goal was to operationalize the machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project the following objectives were carried out:
* Tested the project code using linting
* Completed a Dockerfile to containerize the application
* Deployed the containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improved the log statements in the source code for the application
* Configured Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deployed a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Uploaded a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that the code has been tested


## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python3 app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl
